Changes to be made

1.  change "iden" to "diag"

2.  Make it work with ggplot2's aes function
	i.e.  if we do 
		ggpairs(iris, colour = Species)
	it should split all the colors where possible - density, scatter, dot, ...
	
3.  Make it so that 



4.  Change the collection of "plots" into a 'local' list instead of a 'global' list
	Have ggpairs return the list but make the class of the list so that it when returned, it prints all the plots at the end of the function.
	
	then putPlot would be more like putPlot(ggpairsObj, x, y, newPlot)
	and changes would be made to other functions as well
	
	The list would contain the viewports .v1 and.v2 and the number of columns so that no globals are used

ggpairs(...
{
	...
	
	for(...
	{
		...
		plotList <- c(plotList, plot)
		
		"remove axes and legend"
		
		plottedList <- c(plottedList, plot)
	}
	
	
	superList <- list(columns = numCol, viewports = c(v1,v2), plots = plotList)
	
	superList
}
