No revdep authors were emailed as it is only small bug fixes and url link fixes.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do.  Thank you for your time.

Best,
Barret

## Reverse dependencies
I did not run against reverse dependencies as the changes were small, corrective bug fixes or documentation changes requested by CRAN.
